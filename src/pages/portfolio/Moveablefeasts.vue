                Moveable Feasts is an online platform which is organized around collecting an encyclopedia of Shanghai streetfood; tracing recipes; collecting origin stories, gathering information on cooking procedures and tools; mapping vendors and stalls throughout
                the city. The website began with an open call to designers, artists, scholars, students and foodies of all types to come map, document, co-create, re-invent and preserve Shanghaiâ€™s street food. In the past two years, we have been involving
                students from several courses both at Tongji and at NYU. These classes are based on experiments with - eld research, digital platforms, communication and service design, and contribute to a variety of open projects about streetfood and
                its role as social infrastructure in the city of the future.
